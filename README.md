# AGameOfLife
To interact with the game, the mouse can be clicked or dragged to select cells and invert their current state. To interact with the "infinite" grid, the WASD keys can be used to navigate. However, this does cause quite a few issues, or at least interesting situations.

In addition to this, I have incorperated two buttons to iterate through the grids life span. One evolves the grid once, and the other automatically in a period of time.

Overall, this was an interesting experience, although there are things I would like to have done differently, I am quite pleased with the outcome. Thank you for this opprotunity, and for both your time and consideration.
